# Pathfinding Visualizer

A simple pathfinding visualizer that I developed using JavaScript. I made this application because I am fascinated by all sorts of algorithms, namely sorting and pathfinding.

By visualizing how they work, I hope that I can help others learn about them and inspire them to learn more about them!

You can try it out here! (Chrome browser preferred)
